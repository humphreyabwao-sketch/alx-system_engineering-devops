This commit adds three Bash scripts and a detailed README file for configuring an Ubuntu server and performing network-related tasks. The scripts include:

    0-change_your_home_IP: Configures the server to resolve localhost to 127.0.0.2 and facebook.com to 8.8.8.8.
    1-show_attached_IPs: Displays all active IPv4 IPs on the machine.
    100-port_listening_on_localhost: Listens on port 98 on localhost.

The README file provides instructions, examples, and explanations for each script. These scripts can be used for network configuration, debugging, and troubleshooting purposes.
